# ImageProcessingProject

> This code is the result of a project I did in a team for the image processing course of CentraleSup√©lec in 2020.

## Objective 

In this project, we had to study the effect of parameters of different approximations and methods of convolution, as well as the algorithms efficiency.
The mainDemo.m file displays our results when you run it.
